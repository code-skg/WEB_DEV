                ndia, officially the Republic of India,[j][21] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by
                area; the most populous country from June 2023 onwards;[22][23] and since its independence in 1947, the world's most
                populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the
                Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[k] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the
                north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is near Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its

                In the early mediaeval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern
                and western coasts.[46] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains.[47] The
                resulting Delhi Sultanate drew northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of mediaeval Islam.[48] In south India,
                the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture.[49] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged,
                rejecting institutionalised religion.[50] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative
                peace,[51] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[m][52] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India
                Company followed. It turned India into a colonial economy but consolidated its sovereignty.[53] British Crown rule
                began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[54][55] but technological changes were
                introduced, and modern ideas of education and public life took root.[56] A pioneering and influential nationalist
                movement emerged. Noted for nonviolent resistance it became the major factor in ending British rule.[57][58] In
                1947, the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[59][60][61][62] a Hindu-majority
                dominion of India and a Muslim-majority dominion of Pakistan. A large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented
                migration accompanied the partition.[63]

                India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a
                pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4
                billion in 2022.[64] During this time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and
                its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. A comparatively destitute country in 1951,[65] India has become a fast-growing
                major economy and a hub for information technology services; it has an expanding middle class.[66] Indian movies and
                music increasingly influence global culture.[67] India has reduced its poverty rate, though at the cost of
                increasing economic inequality.[68] It is a nuclear-weapon state that ranks high in military expenditure. It has
                disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[69] Among the
                socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[70] and rising levels of air
                pollution.[71] India's land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots.[72] India's wildlife, which has
                traditionally been viewed with tolerance in its culture,[73] is supported among these forests and elsewhere in
                protected habitats.
